# Phase1-Final-Project

### Overview
Sunil's Card Shop will be an auction site to auction off a collection of "YuGiOh" brand cards.
Visitors will be able to view a collection of available cards, and from there, they can choose to bid on a certain card or buy that card at a set price.
Users will also be able to submit a card for auction. They will enter the card's information as well as a link to a picture of the card. When submitted a preview of the card will be shown on the bottom of the screen, and when the card collection is loaded, their card will be at the bottom of the list.



### Features
The page will load with a menu, a countdown timer, and two Buttons. 
The "View Collection" button will pull up a list of cards from a server and display them on the page.
The "Auction New Card" button will let the user upload their own card, using a form, to the server for auction. 
Each card will have two buttons attached to them:
The Bid button will increment the value of the card by $5, with bidding starting at $5
The Purchase button will let the user purchase the card at a set price and remove the card from auction.
